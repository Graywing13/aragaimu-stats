# About

https://graywing13.github.io/aragaimu-stats/

This website was made for Aragaimu 2025. Most of the functionality will not work with a different set of players.
There are currently no plans to make this extensible.
If you want to use this for your own 2v2, edit the files in the `/src/assets/data` folder, and credit this site in your
repository and website.
Other game formats may potentially work (untested). Mileage may very.
